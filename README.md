# Air-Quality-Analysis

Type of work: Individual data science project

Summary: This project focused on the analysis and prediction of air pollution levels using a real-world dataset sourced from Kaggle using Python libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn). The data included chemical sensor readings and climate conditions recorded hourly, which were used to predict the concentration of benzene (C₆H₆) in the air. The project demonstrated a full data analysis pipeline: cleaning and preprocessing raw data, performing exploratory data analysis, engineering features, building regression models, and evaluating their performance. 
    
Key skills:

•	Data cleaning & Preprocessing

•	Exploratory data analysis & Statistical analysis

•	Feature engineering & Selection

•	Model evaluation & Validation

•	Data visualization

Project results:

•	Conducted full-cycle analysis of over 9,000 time-series records of air quality data.

•	Imputed missing values using k-NN algorithm.

•	Identified and excluded a feature highly correlated with the target variable.

•	Evaluated 5 regression models using the R² metric: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Polynomial Regression, k-NN Regression.

•	Final model explained 98% of test set variance and achieved a low mean absolute error.
